# Bank Personal Loan Modelling
This Project was developed by a team of 4 members as a part of Applied Statistics and Visualization for Analytics under the guidance of Professor. Scott A. bruce.
# About The Project
In recent years, the number of people applying for loans has risen for a variety of reasons. Bank employees are unable to assess or foresee whether a 
borrower will be able to repay the loan (good or poor customer) at the specified interest rate. The classification aim is to forecast the probability 
of a liability consumer purchasing personal loans, we would develop a model that will be used to determine which customers are most likely to approve 
a personal loan deal based on their relationship with the bank as well as other features in the dataset. We will be using various methods to predict 
which model, out of Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Algorithm, is the best for this problem.
